  <dd>Branches are highly important. Branches create a safe space in a parallel world where you can work on the same project as another developer simultaneously. Creating branches helps to keep your main branch safe and in good working condition.<br/><br/>

  </dd>

 <dt style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">‚≠êÔ∏è git pull</dt>
  <dd>Git pull allows us to receive updates from the remote repository.This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git pull, it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).</dd>

 <dt style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">‚≠êÔ∏è git merge</dt>
  <dd>Once everything on your branch is working and how you intend for it to be, the final step is to merge the branch with your main branch. Git merge will allow you to do this.<br/><br/>

  Git merge integrates your feature branch with all of it's commits into your main branch. You may have to resolve some merge conflicts but once they have been sorted through you will be able to safely merge your feature branch into your main.
